SFPI: Tenstorrent SFPU programming interface
============================================

This repo contains SFPI.

* sfpi header files in `include`
* TT-enhanced RISC-V `binutils` in binutils submodule
* TT-enhanced RISC-V `gcc` in gcc submodule
* standard newlib in `newlib` submodule
* standard qemu in `qemu` submodule
* RiscV dejagnu harness in `riscv-dejagnu` submodule
* tests in `tests`
* build and release scripts in `scripts`

GCC, Binutils, Newlib, Qemu and Dejagnu are (naturally) released under
their own licenses.

The release versioning here is simply an integral version
numbering. The major version /does not/ indicate API breaking
changes. It will be incremented when updating the compiler to a new
upstream version. (There may be other reasons to increment.)

### User Documentation

https://docs.tenstorrent.com/tt-metalium/latest/tt_metal/apis/kernel_apis/sfpu/llk.html

### Obtaining Full Source

The Github-provided source tarballs (sfpi-$VERSION.tar.gz) do not
contain the submodule source code. To obtain the full sources:

* Clone the sfpi repo: `git clone https://github.com/tenstorrent/sfpi.git`
* Enter the repo: `cd sfpi`
* Checkout the release using the tag: `git checkout $VERSION`
* Update the submodules: `git submodule update --init --recursive`

### Building
1) Clone the sfpi repo, & initialize submodules:
```
  git clone git@github.com:tenstorrent-metal/sfpi.git
  git submodule update --init --recursive
```

2) Build the compiler:
```
  scripts/build.sh
```

  This will configure and build using the toplevel `configure` and
  `Makefile.in`, which originate from the RISC-V repo
  (https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain). The build is
  performed in a `build` subdirectory and a `sfpi/src-hashes` file is
  created there to record the source tree state at the start of a
  build. When making a release, you will want this to match upstream
  committed sources. If you want to build in a different subdirectory
  use the `--dir=$DIR` option.

  You may add a `--checking=VALUE` option to control gcc's checking --
  see gcc's documentation.  The default is `release`. Note this does
  not control how gcc itself is optimized (which is usually `-O2`).

  If the build is interrupted, you can of course enter the appropriate
  subdirectory and manually resume after correcting the problem --
  such build would not be suitable for releasing though.

  See below about the various `--test` options that may also be used.

3) Build and running the sfpi tests:

```
    ln -s ../tests build
    CC_PATH=$(pwd)/build/sfpi/compiler make -C build/tests all
    CC_PATH=$(pwd)/build/sfpi/compiler make -C build/tests test
```

  If the `all` target succeeds, the compiler at least exports the
  right intrinsics for use w/ the synced sfpi. If it fails to build,
  there is likely a sync error (submodule out of date) between what
  the compiler is exposing and what sfpi is calling.

  The `test` target builds kernels and verifies the resulting assembly
  is the same as a set of gold-standard files. This is unfortunately brittle.

4) Create a release

  * Update the `version` file to the new version number. That version
  will be augmented by the git branch name (the last component of a
  `/`-separated branch name), unless you're on `main`. This is
  recorded in a `version` file placed in the build directory.

  * Then build a release as described above.

  * To create the release artifacts:

```
  scripts/release.sh
```

  The same `--dir=$DIR` option as the build script is accepted. It
  will verify the source hashes are unchanged from when the build
  started. You may override this check with the `--force` option, but
  /be careful/.

  Both a tarball and an md5 file are created in the build
  directory.  These have a basename of`sfpi-$(uname -m)-$(uname -s)`
  and a `.tgz` or `.md5` extension respectively. The host binaries
  therein are stripped.

  Supplying the `--debian` option additionally builds a `.deb` Debian package.
  The Debian control metadata automatically infers the system architecture
  (e.g., amd64, arm64).

5) Making the release available (from github)

  Upload the tarball and md5 hash as a binary file added to a git
  hub. You'll want to set the version tag to be the same as the
  version string created during the build process.

  Users may automate downloading by augmenting their cmake `CMakeLists.txt`
  file with something like:
```
include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(
    sfpi
    URL https://github.com/$REPO/releases/download/$VERSION/sfpi-x86_64-Linux.tgz
    URL_HASH MD5=$HASH
    SOURCE_DIR $INSTALL_LOCATION
)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(sfpi)
```

where:
* $REPO is the repository containing the release (`tenstorrent/sfpi` for tenstorrent releases)
* $VERSION is the version to download
* $HASH is the md5 hash of the tarball
* $INSTALL_LOCATION is where to place the tarball's contents.

Refer to cmake documentation for further information about
`FetchContent`, `FetchContent_Declare` and
`FetchContent_MakeAvailable`.

8) Running the toolchain test suites:
```
  scripts/build.sh --test
```

This will build qemu and the riscv dejagnu components, and then run the testsuites.

If you just want a binutils or gcc:
```
  scripts/build.sh --test-binutils
```
or
```
  scripts/build.sh --test-gcc
```

After the dejagnu tests have executed, the summary files (`$tool.sum`)
are post processed using local xfail files in the `xfails`
directory. This filters out additional fails that are due to
limitations of the test environment or deemed expected for some other
reason. The post processed files are placed in the `build` directory,
the originals are left unchanged.

Note that these dejagnu test runs are idempotent. If you want to
repeat a test run you will need to delete the stamp file in
`build/stamps` (`check-binutils-newlib` or `check-gcc-newlib`). Note
that the post processing is run each time, and thus the processed
summary files will change if the xfail files are adjusted.

9) Running the TT-specific parts of the toolchain tests.
```
  scripts/build.sh --test-tt
```

This will run just the tt-specific subdirectories of the compiler
testsuites.  The summary files are copied to the build directory /but/
are not post processed as described above. Unlike running the full
testsuite, this operation is /not/ idempotent -- there is no need to
delete a stamp file to rerun them.

10) Running the gcc testsuite with specific options:
```
PATH=$(pwd)/build/sfpi/compiler/bin:$(pwd)/build/test-infra/bin:$PATH \
make -C build/build-gcc-newlib-stage2/gcc check-gcc \
    "RUNTESTFLAGS=--target_board=riscv-sim/mcpu=tt-bh"
```

Alter the value passed to RUNTESTFLAGS as desired, for instance
`riscv-sim/mcpu=tt-wh`.  Add `-v` options to get more logging to the
resulting dejagnu log file.
